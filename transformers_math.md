## 1. Roadmap

We begin with optimization fundamentals and high-dimensional geometry, then build attention as a principled similarity search mechanism. The journey: **gradients → similarity metrics → attention → multi-head attention → full Transformer blocks → efficient inference**. Each step connects mathematical theory to practical implementation, culminating in a complete understanding of how Transformers process sequences through learned representations and attention-based information routing.

## 2. Mathematical Preliminaries

### 2.1 Linear Algebra Essentials

**What is a vector?** Think of it as an arrow in space that has both direction and length. In transformers, vectors represent word meanings - words with similar meanings point in similar directions.

**Vectors and Norms:** For $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (a vector with d numbers):
- L2 norm: $\|\mathbf{v}\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^d v_i^2}$ 
  - **What this means:** The "length" of the vector, like measuring a stick with a ruler
  - **Why it matters:** Longer vectors represent "stronger" or "more confident" representations

- Inner product: $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \mathbf{u}^T \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^d u_i v_i$
  - **What this measures:** How much two vectors point in the same direction
  - **Intuition:** Like measuring how similar two things are. If vectors represent word meanings, a high inner product means the words are related
  - **Real example:** "king" and "queen" vectors would have a high inner product because they're conceptually similar

**Matrix Operations:** For matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$:
- Matrix multiplication: $(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik}B_{kj}$
  - **What this does:** Combines information from two tables of numbers in a specific way
  - **Think of it as:** Matrix A transforms space, then matrix B transforms it again - like applying two filters in sequence

- Transpose: $(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}$
  - **What transpose ($A^T$) means:** Flip the matrix over its diagonal - rows become columns, columns become rows
  - **Why we use it:** Often we need to "reverse" a transformation or change the direction of information flow

- Block matrices enable efficient computation of attention over sequences
  - **Practical point:** Instead of processing one word at a time, we can process entire sentences at once using matrices

### 2.2 Matrix Calculus Essentials

**What is a gradient?** Think of hiking on a mountain. The gradient at any point tells you the direction of steepest ascent. In machine learning, we want to find the valley (minimum loss), so we go in the opposite direction of the gradient - downhill.

**Gradient Shapes:** If $f: \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \to \mathbb{R}$, then $\nabla_X f \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$

**What this means:** The gradient has the same shape as what you're taking the gradient with respect to. If X is a 3×4 matrix, its gradient is also 3×4. This makes sense - you need to know how much to adjust each individual number in X.

**Chain Rule:** For $f(g(x))$: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial g} \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$

**Chain rule intuition:** Like a chain reaction. If changing x affects g, and changing g affects f, then the total effect of x on f is the product of both effects. It's like asking "if I turn this knob (x) by a little bit, how much does the final output (f) change?" You multiply the sensitivity at each step.

**Useful Identities:**
- If $Y = AXB$ and $f$ depends on $Y$, then $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} = A^T \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial Y}\right) B^T$.
  **Parameters:** $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r}, X\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times s}, B\in\mathbb{R}^{s\times n}$, so $\partial f/\partial X\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times s}$.
  **Intuition:** Backward through linear maps flips them with transposes.
- $\nabla_X \text{tr}(AX) = A^T$  
- $\nabla_X \|X\|_F^2 = 2X$

**What these mean:**
- The first says "when matrices multiply, gradients flow backward through transposes"
- The second: "the trace (sum of diagonal elements) has a simple gradient"
- The third: "the gradient of squared magnitude is just twice the original" (like how d/dx(x²) = 2x)

### 2.3 Probability & Information Theory

**Softmax as Gibbs Distribution:**
$$\text{softmax}(\mathbf{z})_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{z_j}} \quad (1)$$

**What softmax does intuitively:** Imagine you're choosing which restaurant to go to. Each restaurant has a "score" (z_i). Softmax converts these raw scores into probabilities that sum to 1, like saying "there's a 30% chance I'll pick restaurant A, 50% chance for B, 20% chance for C." The exponential function (e^x) ensures that higher scores get disproportionately higher probabilities - if one restaurant is much better, it gets most of the probability mass.

**Why use exponentials?** Because they're always positive (probabilities can't be negative) and they amplify differences - a score of 5 vs 4 creates a much bigger probability difference than 2 vs 1.

This represents a Gibbs distribution with "energy" $-z_i$ and temperature $T=1$.

**Cross-Entropy Loss:**
$$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \log p_i \quad (2)$$

**What cross-entropy loss does intuitively:** Think of it as a "wrongness penalty." If the model predicts the right answer with high confidence (p_i close to 1), the loss is small. If it predicts the wrong answer or is uncertain about the right answer, the loss is large. The logarithm harshly penalizes being confidently wrong - predicting 0.01% chance for the correct answer gives a huge penalty.

**Why cross-entropy instead of just counting wrong answers?** Because it rewards confidence in correct predictions and punishes overconfidence in wrong ones. It's like the difference between "I'm pretty sure this is right" vs "I'm absolutely certain this is wrong."

**Deeper reasons why cross-entropy is perfect for transformers:**

1. **Information-theoretic foundation:** Cross-entropy measures the "surprise" in the prediction. If the model is confident in the right answer (low surprise), loss is low. If it's surprised by the correct answer (assigned low probability), loss is high.

2. **Matches the softmax output:** Since transformers output probability distributions via softmax, we need a loss function that works with probabilities. Cross-entropy is the natural choice for probability distributions.

3. **Encourages proper calibration:** Unlike squared error, cross-entropy pushes the model to output probabilities that reflect its true confidence. A well-trained model should be right 90% of the time when it says it's 90% confident.

4. **Smooth gradients everywhere:** The gradient of cross-entropy with respect to the final layer outputs is simply (predicted probability - true probability). This creates clean, well-behaved gradients for training.

5. **Class imbalance considerations:** Unweighted cross-entropy does **not** handle class imbalance by itself; use class weights or resampling when imbalance is a concern (language modeling often leaves it unweighted because frequencies reflect the data distribution).

**Mathematical intuition:** The logarithm grows very quickly as probability approaches 0. This means being slightly wrong about a high-confidence prediction gets heavily penalized, encouraging the model to be humble about its uncertainty.

where $y_i$ are true labels (what the answer actually is) and $p_i$ are predicted probabilities (what the model thinks the answer is).

## 3. Calculus to Differential Equations

### 3.1 Gradient Fields and Optimization

**Gradient Descent as Continuous Flow:** Parameter updates $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$ approximate the ODE:
$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta) \quad (3)$$

**Understanding the symbols:**
- $\theta$ (theta): The parameters we want to learn - think of these as the "knobs" we can adjust
- $\eta$ (eta): Learning rate - how big steps we take. Like deciding whether to take baby steps or giant leaps when hiking downhill
- $\nabla$ (nabla): The gradient symbol - points in the direction of steepest ascent (we go opposite direction to descend)
- $\mathcal{L}$ (script L): The loss function - measures how "wrong" our current parameters are

**What the equation means:** "Change the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by the learning rate."

This connects discrete optimization to continuous dynamical systems.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding optimization as flow helps explain momentum methods, learning rate schedules, and convergence behavior.

### 3.2 Residual Connections as Discretized Dynamics

**Residual Block:** $\mathbf{h}_{l+1} = \mathbf{h}_l + F(\mathbf{h}_l)$ approximates:
$$\frac{d\mathbf{h}}{dt} = F(\mathbf{h}) \quad (4)$$

**What residual connections do intuitively:** Think of them as "safety nets" for information. Without residual connections, information would have to successfully pass through every layer to reach the output. With residual connections, information can "skip over" layers that might be learning slowly or poorly.

**Highway analogy:** Imagine driving from city A to city B. Without residual connections, you MUST go through every small town along the way. With residual connections, there's a highway that bypasses some towns - you still visit some towns (transformation), but you're guaranteed to make progress toward your destination even if some towns are roadblocked.

**Why this enables deep networks:** In very deep networks (50+ layers), gradients tend to vanish as they backpropagate. Residual connections provide a "gradient highway" - gradients can flow directly backward through the skip connections, ensuring that even early layers receive useful training signals.

This enables training very deep networks by maintaining gradient flow.

**Stability Consideration:** The transformation $F$ should be well-conditioned to avoid exploding/vanishing gradients.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Residual connection preserves gradient flow
def residual_block(x, transform_fn):
    return x + transform_fn(x)  # Skip connection is crucial
```

## 4. Optimization for Deep Networks

### 4.1 From SGD to Adam

**SGD with Momentum:**
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}_t &= \beta \mathbf{v}_{t-1} + (1-\beta) \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L} \quad (5)\\
\theta_t &= \theta_{t-1} - \eta \mathbf{v}_t \quad (6)
\end{align}$$

**What momentum does:** Like a ball rolling down a hill. Instead of just following the current slope (gradient), momentum keeps some memory of where you were going before. This helps you:
- **Roll through small bumps** (escape local minima)
- **Speed up in consistent directions** (valleys)  
- **Slow down when direction changes** (near the bottom)

**Bowling ball analogy:** A heavy bowling ball doesn't stop immediately when it hits a small bump - it uses its momentum to keep rolling toward the pins (optimal solution).

**Understanding the formula:**
- $\mathbf{v}_t$: Current \"velocity\" (combination of current gradient + previous velocity)
- $\beta \approx 0.9$: How much previous velocity to keep (90%)  
- $(1-\beta) = 0.1$: How much current gradient to use (10%)
- $\eta$: Learning rate (step size)

**Adam Optimizer:** Combines momentum with adaptive learning rates:
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{m}_t &= \beta_1 \mathbf{m}_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L} \quad (7)\\
\mathbf{v}_t &= \beta_2 \mathbf{v}_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) (\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L})^2 \quad (8)\\
\theta_t &= \theta_{t-1} - \eta \frac{\hat{\mathbf{m}}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{\mathbf{v}}_t} + \epsilon} \quad (9)
\end{align}$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{m}}_t$, $\hat{\mathbf{v}}_t$ are bias-corrected estimates.

**What Adam does - explained simply:**

Adam is like having a smart GPS that adjusts your driving based on two things:

1. **$\mathbf{m}_t$ (momentum):** "Which direction have we been going lately?" - Like momentum, but with exponential averaging
2. **$\mathbf{v}_t$ (second moment):** "How bumpy has the road been?" - Tracks how much the gradients have been changing

**The key insight:** If the road has been very bumpy (high variance in gradients), take smaller steps. If it's been smooth and consistent, you can take bigger steps.

**Breaking down the symbols:**
- $\beta_1 \approx 0.9$: How much to remember from previous direction (90%)
- $\beta_2 \approx 0.999$: How much to remember from previous bumpiness (99.9%) 
- $\epsilon \approx 10^{-8}$: Tiny number to prevent division by zero
- $\hat{\mathbf{m}}_t$, $\hat{\mathbf{v}}_t$: Bias-corrected estimates (explained below)

**Bias correction intuition:** At the beginning, $\mathbf{m}_0 = \mathbf{v}_0 = 0$, so the averages are biased toward zero. We correct for this by dividing by $(1-\beta^t)$, which starts small and approaches 1.

**Car analogy:** Adam is like cruise control that:
- Remembers which direction you've been driving (momentum)
- Adjusts speed based on road conditions (adaptive learning rate)
- Starts cautiously but gets more confident over time (bias correction)

### 4.2 Learning Rate Schedules

**Why do we need schedules?** Think of learning to drive: you start slow in the parking lot (warmup), drive at normal speed on the highway (main training), then slow down carefully when approaching your destination (decay).

**Warmup:** Gradually increase learning rate to avoid early instability:
$$\eta_t = \eta_{\text{max}} \cdot \min\left(\frac{t}{T_{\text{warmup}}}, 1\right) \quad (10)$$

**Why warmup works:**
- **Early training is chaotic:** Random initial weights create wild gradients
- **Start gentle:** Small learning rate prevents the model from making terrible early decisions
- **Build confidence gradually:** As the model learns basic patterns, we can be more aggressive

**Driving analogy:** You don't floor the gas pedal the moment you start your car in winter - you let it warm up first.

**Cosine Decay:** Smooth reduction following cosine curve prevents abrupt changes.

**Why cosine decay?** 
- **Smooth slowdown:** Like gradually applying brakes instead of slamming them
- **Fine-tuning phase:** Later in training, we want to make small adjustments, not big jumps
- **Mathematical smoothness:** Cosine provides a natural, smooth curve from 1 to 0

**Formula:**
$$\eta_t = \eta_{\text{max}} \cdot 0.5 \left(1 + \cos\left(\pi \cdot \frac{t - T_{\text{warmup}}}{T_{\text{total}} - T_{\text{warmup}}}\right)\right)$$

**Real-world analogy:** Like landing an airplane - you approach fast, then gradually slow down for a smooth landing, not a crash.

### 4.3 Gradient Clipping

**The Problem:** Sometimes gradients become extremely large (exploding gradients), causing the model to make huge, destructive updates.

**The Solution:** Clip (limit) the gradients to a maximum norm.

**Global Norm Clipping:**
$$\tilde{g} = \min\left(1, \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{g}\|_2}\right) \mathbf{g} \quad (11)$$

**What this does intuitively:**
- Calculate the total "size" of all gradients combined: $\|\mathbf{g}\|_2$
- If this size exceeds our limit $c$, scale all gradients down proportionally
- If it's within the limit, leave gradients unchanged

**Speedometer analogy:** Like a speed limiter in a car. If you try to go 120 mph but the limit is 65 mph, it scales your speed down to 65 mph while keeping you in the same direction.

**Why proportional scaling?** We want to keep the relative direction of updates the same, just make them smaller. It's like turning down the volume on music - all frequencies get reduced equally.

**Example:**
- Your gradients total to norm 50, but your clip value is 5
- Scaling factor: $\min(1, 5/50) = 0.1$  
- All gradients get multiplied by 0.1 (reduced to 10% of original size)

### 4.4 Numerical Stability

**Log-Sum-Exp Trick:** For numerical stability in softmax:
$$\log\left(\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}\right) = c + \log\left(\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i - c}\right) \quad (12)$$

where $c = \max_i x_i$ prevents overflow.

## 5. Multilayer Perceptrons as a Warm-Up

### 5.1 Forward Pass

**Two-layer MLP:**
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{z}^{(1)} &= \mathbf{x} W^{(1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(1)} \quad (13)\\
\mathbf{h}^{(1)} &= \sigma(\mathbf{z}^{(1)}) \quad (14)\\
\mathbf{z}^{(2)} &= \mathbf{h}^{(1)} W^{(2)} + \mathbf{b}^{(2)} \quad (15)
\end{align}$$

**Shape Analysis:** If input $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times d_{\text{in}}}$:
- $W^{(1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{in}} \times d_{\text{hidden}}}$
- $W^{(2)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{hidden}} \times d_{\text{out}}}$

### 5.2 Backpropagation Derivation

**Loss Gradient w.r.t. Output:**
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(2)}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{\mathbf{y}}} \quad (16)$$

**Weight Gradients:**
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(2)}} &= (\mathbf{h}^{(1)})^T \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(2)}} \quad (17)\\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(1)}} &= \mathbf{x}^T \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(2)}} (W^{(2)})^T \odot \sigma'(\mathbf{z}^{(1)})\right) \quad (18)
\end{align}$$

where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

### 5.3 Normalization Techniques

**LayerNorm:** Normalizes across features within each sample:
$$\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x}) = \gamma \odot \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta \quad (19)$$

**Understanding the Greek letters:**
- $\mu$ (mu): The mean (average) of all the numbers
- $\sigma$ (sigma): The standard deviation - how spread out the numbers are from the average
- $\gamma$ (gamma): A learnable scale parameter - lets the model decide how much to amplify the result
- $\beta$ (beta): A learnable shift parameter - lets the model decide how much to shift the result
- $\epsilon$ (epsilon): A tiny number to prevent division by zero

**What LayerNorm does:** "Make all the numbers have zero average and unit variance, then let the model scale and shift them as needed." It's like standardizing test scores so they're all on the same scale.

where $\mu = \frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^d x_i$ and $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^d (x_i - \mu)^2$.

**Why LayerNorm for Sequences:** Unlike BatchNorm, it doesn't depend on batch statistics, making it suitable for variable-length sequences.

## 6. High-Dimensional Geometry & Similarity

### 6.1 Distance Metrics in High Dimensions

**Euclidean Distance:** $d_2(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|_2$

**Cosine Similarity:** $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{u}^T \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|_2 \|\mathbf{v}\|_2}$

**Concentration of Measure:** In high dimensions, most random vectors are approximately orthogonal, making cosine similarity more discriminative than Euclidean distance.

### 6.2 Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)

**Problem:** Find $\mathbf{v}^* = \arg\max_{\mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{v}$

This is exactly what attention computes when finding relevant keys for a given query!

**Connection to Attention:** Query-key similarity in attention is inner product search over learned embeddings.

```python
# High-dimensional similarity comparison
def compare_similarities(q, k_list, normalize=True):
    if normalize:
        q = q / torch.norm(q)
        k_list = [k / torch.norm(k) for k in k_list]
    
    # Inner product similarity (what attention uses)
    similarities = [torch.dot(q, k) for k in k_list]
    return similarities
```

## 7. From Similarity to Attention

### 7.1 Deriving Scaled Dot-Product Attention

**Step 1:** Start with similarity search between query $\mathbf{q}$ and keys $\{\mathbf{k}_i\}$:
$$s_i = \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{k}_i \quad (20)$$

**Step 2:** Convert similarities to weights via softmax:
$$\alpha_i = \frac{e^{s_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{s_j}} \quad (21)$$

**Understanding $\alpha$ (alpha):** These are the attention weights - they tell us "how much should I pay attention to each word?" The $\alpha_i$ values all add up to 1, like percentages.

**Why use softmax instead of just raw similarities?**
1. **Probabilities must sum to 1:** We want a weighted average, so weights must be between 0 and 1 and sum to 1. Raw similarities could be negative or not sum to 1.
2. **Differentiable selection:** Softmax provides a "soft" way to pick the most relevant items. Instead of hard selection (pick the best, ignore the rest), it gives more weight to better matches while still considering others.
3. **Handles different scales:** Raw similarity scores might vary wildly in range. Softmax normalizes them into a consistent 0-1 probability scale.
4. **Amplifies differences:** The exponential in softmax amplifies differences between scores. If one word is much more relevant, it gets much more attention.
5. **Smooth gradients:** Unlike hard max (which would create step functions), softmax is smooth everywhere, enabling gradient-based learning.

**Real-world analogy:** Like deciding how much attention to give each person in a room - you don't ignore everyone except one person (hard max), but you do focus more on the most interesting people while still being somewhat aware of others.

**Step 3:** Aggregate values using weights:
$$\mathbf{o} = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mathbf{v}_i \quad (22)$$

**What this step does:** Take a weighted average of all the value vectors. It's like saying "give me 30% of word 1's information, 50% of word 2's information, and 20% of word 3's information."

**Matrix Form:** For sequences, this becomes:
$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \quad (23)$$

**What this equation accomplishes step-by-step:**
1. $QK^T$ creates a "compatibility matrix" - every query checks against every key
2. $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ scales the scores to prevent them from getting too large
3. $\text{softmax}$ converts raw compatibility scores into probability-like weights
4. Multiply by $V$ to get a weighted sum of value vectors

**Library analogy:** Think of attention like a smart librarian. Q is your question ("I need books about neural networks"), K represents the subject tags of all books, V contains the actual book contents. The librarian (attention mechanism) looks at your question, checks which books are most relevant (QK^T), decides how much attention to give each book (softmax), and gives you a summary that's mostly from the most relevant books but includes a little from others (weighted sum with V).

### 7.2 Why the $\sqrt{d_k}$ Scaling?

**Variance Analysis:** If $Q, K$ have i.i.d. entries with variance $\sigma^2$, then:
$$\text{Var}(QK^T) = d_k \sigma^4 \quad (24)$$

**Understanding $\sigma$ (sigma):** This represents the variance - how spread out the numbers are. Think of it as measuring "how noisy" or "how varied" the data is.

**What "i.i.d." means:** Independent and identically distributed - each number is random and doesn't depend on the others, like rolling dice multiple times.

Without scaling, attention weights become too sharp as $d_k$ increases, leading to poor gradients.

**Pitfall:** Forgetting this scaling leads to attention collapse in high dimensions.

### 7.3 Backpropagation Through Attention

**Softmax Gradient:** For $\mathbf{p} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{z})$:
$$\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial z_j} = p_i(\delta_{ij} - p_j) \quad (25)$$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

**What is $\delta_{ij}$ (delta)?** It's a simple function that equals 1 when i=j (same position) and 0 otherwise. Think of it as asking "are these the same thing?" - if yes, return 1; if no, return 0.

**Attention Gradients:**

Let $S = QK^T/\sqrt{d_k}$, $P=\mathrm{softmax}(S)$ (row-wise), $O = PV$. Given $G_O=\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial O$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
G_V &= P^T G_O,\quad &&\text{(V same shape as }V\text{)}\\
G_P &= G_O V^T,\\
G_{S,r} &= \big(\mathrm{diag}(P_r) - P_r P_r^T\big)\, G_{P,r}\quad &&\text{(row }r\text{; softmax Jacobian)}\\
G_Q &= G_S K/\sqrt{d_k},\quad G_K = G_S^T Q/\sqrt{d_k}.
\end{aligned}
$$

**Parameters:** $Q,K\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d_k}$, $V\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d_v}$.
**Intuition:** Backprop splits into (i) linear parts, (ii) softmax Jacobian per row.

## 8. Multi-Head Attention & Positional Information

### 8.1 Multi-Head as Subspace Projections

**Single Head:** Projects to subspace of dimension $d_k = d_{\text{model}}/h$:
$$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) \quad (29)$$

**Multi-Head Combination:**
$$\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O \quad (30)$$

**Why multiple heads instead of one big head?** Different heads can specialize in different types of relationships:
- **Head 1 might focus on syntax:** "What words are grammatically related?"
- **Head 2 might focus on semantics:** "What words are conceptually similar?"
- **Head 3 might focus on position:** "What words are nearby?"
- **Head 4 might focus on long-range dependencies:** "What words are related despite being far apart?"

**Meeting analogy:** Like having different experts in a meeting. Instead of one generalist trying to understand everything, you have specialists: a grammar expert, a meaning expert, a structure expert, etc. Each contributes their perspective, then all insights are combined (concatenated and projected through $W^O$).

**Why split the dimension?** Rather than having 8 heads each looking at 512-dimensional vectors, we have 8 heads each looking at 64-dimensional projections (512/8=64). This forces each head to focus on a specific subset of features, encouraging specialization.

**Implementation Details:**

**Linear Projections (Not MLPs):**
Each head uses simple linear transformations:
- $W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k}$ where $d_k = d_{\text{model}}/h$
- These are **single linear layers**, not multi-layer perceptrons
- Total projection parameters per layer: $3 \times h \times d_{\text{model}} \times d_k = 3d_{\text{model}}^2$

**Efficient Implementation:**
Instead of computing each head separately, implementations often:
1. Concatenate all head projections: $W^Q = [W_1^Q, W_2^Q, ..., W_h^Q] \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$
2. Compute $Q = XW^Q, K = XW^K, V = XW^V$ in parallel
3. Reshape tensors to separate heads: $(n, d_{\text{model}}) \to (n, h, d_k)$
4. Apply attention computation across all heads simultaneously

**Parameter Analysis:**
- **Per-head projections**: $3 \times d_{\text{model}} \times d_k = 3 \times d_{\text{model}} \times (d_{\text{model}}/h)$
- **Total projections**: $3d_{\text{model}}^2$ (same as single-head with full dimension)
- **Output projection**: $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$ adds $d_{\text{model}}^2$ parameters
- **Total multi-head parameters**: $4d_{\text{model}}^2$

### 8.2 Positional Encodings

**Sinusoidal Encoding:** Provides absolute position information:
$$\begin{align}
PE_{(pos,2i)} &= \sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}) \quad (31)\\
PE_{(pos,2i+1)} &= \cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}) \quad (32)
\end{align}$$

**Mathematical Properties of Sinusoidal Encoding:**
- **Linearity**: For any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be expressed as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$
- **Relative position encoding**: The dot product $PE_{pos_i} \cdot PE_{pos_j}$ depends only on $|pos_i - pos_j|$
- **Extrapolation**: Can handle sequences longer than seen during training

**RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding):** Rotates query-key pairs by position-dependent angles:
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{q}_m^{(i)} &= R_{\Theta,m}^{(i)} \mathbf{q}^{(i)} \quad (33)\\
\mathbf{k}_n^{(i)} &= R_{\Theta,n}^{(i)} \mathbf{k}^{(i)} \quad (34)
\end{align}$$

**RoPE Rotation Matrix:**
$$R_{\Theta,m}^{(i)} = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos(m\theta_i) & -\sin(m\theta_i) \\
\sin(m\theta_i) & \cos(m\theta_i)
\end{pmatrix}$$

where $\theta_i = 10000^{-2i/d_{\text{model}}}$ for dimension pairs.

**Key RoPE Properties:**
- **Relative position dependency**: $\mathbf{q}_m^T \mathbf{k}_n$ depends only on $(m-n)$, not absolute positions
- **Length preservation**: Rotation matrices preserve vector norms
- **Computational efficiency**: Can be implemented without explicit matrix multiplication
- **Long sequence generalization**: Better extrapolation to longer sequences than learned embeddings

**RoPE Implementation Insight:** Instead of rotating the full vectors, RoPE applies rotations to consecutive dimension pairs, enabling efficient implementation via element-wise operations.

```python
# Simplified RoPE implementation
def apply_rope(x, position, dim):
    # x: [seq_len, dim]
    seq_len, d = x.shape
    theta = 1.0 / (10000 ** (torch.arange(0, d, 2).float() / d))
    
    angles = position[:, None] * theta[None, :]  # [seq_len, d//2]
    cos_angles = torch.cos(angles)
    sin_angles = torch.sin(angles)
    
    # Apply rotation to even-odd pairs
    x_even = x[:, 0::2]
    x_odd = x[:, 1::2]
    
    rotated_even = cos_angles * x_even - sin_angles * x_odd
    rotated_odd = sin_angles * x_even + cos_angles * x_odd
    
    # Interleave back
    result = torch.zeros_like(x)
    result[:, 0::2] = rotated_even
    result[:, 1::2] = rotated_odd
    
    return result
```

## 9. Transformer Block Mathematics

### 9.1 Complete Block Equations

**Pre-LayerNorm Architecture:**
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{h}_1 &= \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x}) \quad (35)\\
\mathbf{h}_2 &= \mathbf{x} + \text{MultiHeadAttn}(\mathbf{h}_1, \mathbf{h}_1, \mathbf{h}_1) \quad (36)\\
\mathbf{h}_3 &= \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{h}_2) \quad (37)\\
\mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{h}_2 + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{h}_3) \quad (38)
\end{align}$$

**Feed-Forward Network:**
$$\text{FFN}(\mathbf{x}) = \text{GELU}(\mathbf{x}W_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)W_2 + \mathbf{b}_2 \quad (39)$$

**What the FFN does intuitively:** Think of it as a "thinking step" for each word individually. After attention has mixed information between words, the FFN lets each word "process" and transform its representation. It's like giving each word some individual processing time to digest the information it received from other words.

**Why expand then contract?** The FFN first expands the representation to a higher dimension (usually 4× larger), applies a nonlinearity, then contracts back down. This is like having a "working space" where the model can perform more complex computations before producing the final result.

**Shape Tracking:** For input $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{\text{model}}}$:
- $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{ffn}}}$ (typically $d_{\text{ffn}} = 4d_{\text{model}}$) - "expansion layer"
- $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ffn}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$ - "contraction layer"

### 9.2 Why GELU over ReLU?

**GELU Definition:**
$$\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) \quad (40)$$

**What GELU does intuitively:** GELU is like a "smooth switch." Unlike ReLU which harshly cuts off negative values to zero, GELU gradually transitions from "mostly off" to "mostly on." It asks "how much should I activate this neuron?" and gives a smooth answer between 0 and the input value.

**Why smoother is better:**
- **Better gradients:** ReLU has a sharp corner at zero (gradient jumps from 0 to 1). GELU is smooth everywhere, so gradients flow better during training.
- **Probabilistic interpretation:** GELU can be seen as randomly dropping out inputs based on their value - inputs closer to the mean of a normal distribution are more likely to "survive."
- **More expressive:** The smooth transition lets the model make more nuanced decisions about what information to keep.

**Real-world analogy:** ReLU is like a light switch (on/off), while GELU is like a dimmer switch (gradual control).

where $\Phi(x)$ is the standard normal CDF (cumulative distribution function - tells you the probability that a normal random variable is less than x). GELU provides smoother gradients than ReLU, improving optimization.

## 10. Training Objective & Tokenization/Embeddings

### 10.1 Next-Token Prediction

**Autoregressive Objective:**
$$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{t=1}^T \log P(x_t | x_1, ..., x_{t-1}) \quad (41)$$

**Implementation:** Use causal mask in attention to prevent information leakage from future tokens.

### 10.2 Embedding Mathematics

**Token Embeddings:** Map discrete tokens to continuous vectors:
$$\mathbf{e}_i = E[i] \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}} \quad (42)$$

where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times d_{\text{model}}}$ is the embedding matrix.

**Weight Tying:** Share embedding matrix $E$ with output projection to reduce parameters:
$$P(w_t | \text{context}) = \text{softmax}(E \mathbf{h}_t) \quad (43)$$

**Perplexity:** Measures model uncertainty:
$$\text{PPL} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \log P(x_t | x_{<t})\right) \quad (44)$$

## 11. Efficient Attention & Scaling

### 11.1 Complexity Analysis

**Standard Attention Complexity:**
- Time: $O(n^2 d)$ for sequence length $n$, model dimension $d$
- Space: $O(n^2 + nd)$ for attention matrix and activations

**Memory Bottleneck:** Attention matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ dominates memory usage for long sequences.

**Detailed Complexity Breakdown:**
1. **QK^T computation**: $O(n^2 d)$ time, $O(n^2)$ space
2. **Softmax normalization**: $O(n^2)$ time and space
3. **Attention-Value multiplication**: $O(n^2 d)$ time, $O(nd)$ space
4. **Total**: $O(n^2 d)$ time, $O(n^2 + nd)$ space

**Scaling Challenges:**
- Quadratic scaling limits practical sequence lengths
- Memory requirements grow quadratically with sequence length
- Computational cost increases quadratically even with parallelization

### 11.2 KV Caching for Autoregressive Generation

**Key Insight:** During generation, keys and values for previous tokens don't change.

**Cache Update:**
$$\begin{align}
K_{\text{cache}} &= [K_{\text{cache}}; k_{\text{new}}] \quad (45)\\
V_{\text{cache}} &= [V_{\text{cache}}; v_{\text{new}}] \quad (46)\\
\text{Attention} &= \text{softmax}(q_{\text{new}} K_{\text{cache}}^T / \sqrt{d_k}) V_{\text{cache}} \quad (47)
\end{align}$$

**Memory Trade-off:** Cache size grows as $O(nd)$ but eliminates $O(n^2)$ recomputation.

```python
# KV Cache implementation
class KVCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.keys = None
        self.values = None
    
    def update(self, new_keys, new_values):
        if self.keys is None:
            self.keys = new_keys
            self.values = new_values
        else:
            self.keys = torch.cat([self.keys, new_keys], dim=1)
            self.values = torch.cat([self.values, new_values], dim=1)
        
        return self.keys, self.values
```

### 11.3 Linear Attention Approximations

**Kernel Method View:** Approximate $\text{softmax}(\mathbf{q}^T\mathbf{k})$ with $\phi(\mathbf{q})^T \phi(\mathbf{k})$ for feature map $\phi$.

**Linear Attention:**
$$\text{LinAttn}(Q,K,V) = \frac{\phi(Q)(\phi(K)^T V)}{\phi(Q)(\phi(K)^T \mathbf{1})} \quad (48)$$

**Complexity Reduction:** Reduces from $O(n^2 d)$ to $O(nd^2)$ when $d < n$.

## 12. Regularization, Generalization, and Calibration

### 12.1 Dropout in Transformers

**Attention Dropout:** Applied to attention weights:
$$A_{\text{dropped}} = \text{Dropout}(\text{softmax}(QK^T/\sqrt{d_k})) \quad (49)$$

**FFN Dropout:** Applied after first linear transformation:
$$\text{FFN}(\mathbf{x}) = W_2 \cdot \text{Dropout}(\text{GELU}(W_1 \mathbf{x})) \quad (50)$$

### 12.2 Label Smoothing

**Smooth Labels:** Replace one-hot targets with:
$$y_{\text{smooth}} = (1-\alpha) y_{\text{true}} + \frac{\alpha}{V} \mathbf{1} \quad (51)$$

**Effect on Gradients:** Prevents overconfident predictions and improves calibration.

## 13. Practical Numerics & Implementation Notes

### 13.1 Initialization Strategies

**Xavier/Glorot for Linear Layers:**
$$W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{\text{in}} + n_{\text{out}}}\right) \quad (52)$$

**Attention-Specific:** Initialize query/key projections with smaller variance to prevent attention collapse.

### 13.2 Mixed Precision Training

**FP16 Forward, FP32 Gradients:** Use half precision for speed, full precision for numerical stability:
```python
# Automatic Mixed Precision pattern
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    output = model(input)
    loss = criterion(output, target)

scaler.scale(loss).backward()
scaler.step(optimizer)
```

### 13.3 Gradient Clipping

**Global Norm Clipping:**
$$\tilde{g} = \min\left(1, \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{g}\|_2}\right) \mathbf{g} \quad (53)$$

where $c$ is the clip threshold. Prevents exploding gradients in deep networks.

## 14. Worked Mini-Examples

### 14.1 Tiny Attention Forward Pass

**Setup:** $n=2$ tokens, $d_k=d_v=3$, single head.

**Input:**
```
Q = [[1, 0, 1],    K = [[1, 1, 0],    V = [[2, 0, 1],
     [0, 1, 1]]         [1, 0, 1]]         [1, 1, 0]]
```

**Step 1:** Compute scores $S = QK^T/\sqrt{3}$:
$$S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\begin{bmatrix}1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 & 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1\\0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 & 0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\1 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

**Step 2:** Apply softmax:
$$A = \begin{bmatrix}e^{1/\sqrt{3}}/(e^{1/\sqrt{3}}+e^{2/\sqrt{3}}) & e^{2/\sqrt{3}}/(e^{1/\sqrt{3}}+e^{2/\sqrt{3}})\\e^{1/\sqrt{3}}/(e^{1/\sqrt{3}}+e^{1/\sqrt{3}}) & e^{1/\sqrt{3}}/(e^{1/\sqrt{3}}+e^{1/\sqrt{3}})\end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix}0.38 & 0.62\\0.5 & 0.5\end{bmatrix}$$

**Step 3:** Compute output $O = AV$:
$$O \approx \begin{bmatrix}0.38 \times 2 + 0.62 \times 1 & 0.38 \times 0 + 0.62 \times 1 & 0.38 \times 1 + 0.62 \times 0\\0.5 \times 2 + 0.5 \times 1 & 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 1 & 0.5 \times 1 + 0.5 \times 0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1.38 & 0.62 & 0.38\\1.5 & 0.5 & 0.5\end{bmatrix}$$

### 14.2 Backprop Through Simple Attention

**Given:** $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial O} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1\\0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$

**Gradient w.r.t. Values:**
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial V} = A^T \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial O} = \begin{bmatrix}0.38 & 0.5\\0.62 & 0.5\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1\\0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0.38 & 0.5 & 0.38\\0.62 & 0.5 & 0.62\end{bmatrix}$$

**Check for Understanding:** Verify that gradient shapes match parameter shapes and that the chain rule is applied correctly.

## 15. Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions

### 15.1 High-Dimensional Distance Misconceptions

**Pitfall:** Using Euclidean distance instead of cosine similarity in high dimensions.
**Fix:** In $d > 100$, most vectors are approximately orthogonal, making cosine similarity more discriminative.

### 15.2 Attention Scaling Mistakes

**Pitfall:** Forgetting $1/\sqrt{d_k}$ scaling or using wrong dimension.
**Symptom:** Attention weights become too peaked, leading to poor gradients.
**Fix:** Always scale by $\sqrt{d_k}$ where $d_k$ is the key dimension. Note that $d_k=d_{\text{model}}/h$ under common implementations.

### 15.3 LayerNorm Placement

**Pitfall:** Using post-LayerNorm (original) instead of pre-LayerNorm (modern).
**Issue:** Post-LN can lead to training instability in deep models.
**Modern Practice:** Apply LayerNorm before attention and FFN blocks.

### 15.4 Softmax Temperature Misuse

**Pitfall:** Applying temperature scaling inconsistently.
**Correct Usage:** Temperature $\tau$ in $\text{softmax}(\mathbf{z}/\tau)$ controls sharpness:
- $\tau > 1$: Smoother distribution
- $\tau < 1$: Sharper distribution
