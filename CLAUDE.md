For Tutorial Generation 
- Use Markdown formatting.
- Include a Table of Contents at the top.
- Write all explanations and examples at a Freshman college level.
- Examples should be:
  - Consumable by a general audience (non-experts),
  - But not too simplified (avoid middle-school-level content).
- Maintain a clear and engaging narrative flow.
- Avoid choppy or disjointed transitions caused by excessive bolded subheadings.
- Express the reasoning naturally within the paragraph or inline sentence in a more engaging way.
- Where relevant, use light narrative flow (e.g., “Now let’s explore…”)
- Use $$ for all math equations (LaTeX block math). It must be clearly rendered in github webpage.
- Every parameters in the formulat must be clearly explained.
- Use text-based diagrams (ASCII art or schematic text) where it adds clarity. 
- Pay extra attention to clearly render the ascii characters, make sure the spacings are correct.
- Add any new glossary terms to glossary.md

For Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) Generation
- Include a brief markdown description at the beginning of each code cell explaining what it does.
- Write clean, readable code using Python and PyTorch.
- Code must be executable with environment like colab and should follow recommended best practice.
- Add in-line comments within code blocks to clarify logic and purpose.
- Review requirements.txt in the pynb folder and update if needed.
