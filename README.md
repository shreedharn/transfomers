### ⚡ Quick Overview
*Brief introduction to transformers*

**What are transformers?** AI models that excel at understanding and generating human-like text.

**Why do they matter?** They power ChatGPT, GPT-4, BERT, and most modern AI systems.

**How do they work?** Instead of reading text word-by-word (like humans), they read all words simultaneously and figure out which words are most important to pay attention to for understanding meaning.

**🔍 Key Innovation**: The "attention mechanism" - the ability to focus on relevant parts of text while ignoring irrelevant parts.

**📈 Real-world impact**: 
- **ChatGPT**: Conversational AI
- **Google Search**: Understanding search queries  
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion
- **Google Translate**: Language translation
